                <h2> What is the main difference between localStorage and session storage?</h2>
                <p> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. 
                    The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is
                     that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when
                      the page session ends.</p>

                <h2> What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
                <p> In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>

                <h2> How does javascript event loop work?</h2>
                <p> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h2> How i am get undefined in javascript?</h2>
                <p> I will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.</p>
